It's easy, they said. 
It was the first practice for us in JavaScript without doing any kind of logical or algorithm exercises. 

Was tough but we made it. It took few hours but we learnt how implement some objects like Map
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) and IndexOf methods.

Then they realized that, as we were learning JS from scratch, we should do some easier practices.
